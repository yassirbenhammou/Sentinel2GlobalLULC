# Sentinel2GlobalLULC
In this repository, we provide all the used scripts to create Sentinel2GlobalLULC Dataset and explain each step of their usage.
This Repository contains 7 folders. In the following, we explain the utility of each folder and how to use it :

1- LULC classes scripts: In this folder you'll find all GEE javascripts used to create Sentinel2GlobalLULC classes. Each one of the 29 LULC classes has a script file able to create its final map, reproject it and process it. Files are organized into subfolders in the same hierchical structure illustrated in Figure 2 of Sentinel2GlobalLULC manuscript. Tu use these scripts, you can open a new file in GEE and copy the content of these script in GEE.
